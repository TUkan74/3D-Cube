# C# Cube Renderer

This C# application demonstrates a simple 3D cube rendering on a Windows Form. The cube can be rotated along the X, Y, and Z axes using keyboard inputs. Additional controls allow for starting or stopping the rotation, adjusting the rotation speed, and toggling the drawing of lines and sides of the cube.

## Installation

Ensure you have a C# development environment set up, such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), which supports Windows Forms applications. No additional external libraries are required as the application uses only standard libraries provided by the .NET Framework.

## Usage

To use the application, compile and run the `Form1.cs` file within your C# IDE. The form will display a rendered cube that can be interacted with using keyboard controls.

## Features

- **3D Cube Rendering:** Displays a cube that can be viewed from different angles by rotating it along its axes.
- **Interactive Controls:** Use keyboard inputs to control the rotation and view of the cube.
- **Customization Options:** Toggle the drawing of the cube's sides and lines for different visual effects.

## Controls

- **Rotate Cube:** Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to rotate the cube around the X (W/S) and Y (A/D) axes.
- **Toggle Rotation:** Press `Enter` to start or stop the automatic rotation of the cube.
- **Adjust Distance:** Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to adjust the cube's distance from the viewpoint, effectively zooming in and out.
- **Reset Cube:** Press `R` to reset the cube to its initial rotation and position settings.
- **Exit Application:** Press `Escape` to exit the application.

## Building the Application

- Open the solution in Visual Studio.
- Build the solution by navigating to `Build > Build Solution`.
